Teaching myself python through projects

I am trying to learn python from scratch. And I have just completed the tutorial called "Python for Beginners - Learn Python in 1 Hour" by programmering with Mosh. 

So, I have followed the video and made the exercises. So, now I have to make some projects of mine own to really know that I have understood the video. 

so, today I went online and found this website called freecodecamp with its article : "25 Python Projects for Beginners â€“ Easy Ideas to Get Started Coding Python" 

So, I am just trying to make one project each day, and hopefully I can move on to more intermediate stuff.
